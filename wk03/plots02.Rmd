## Zipf's Law
Words are fancy. And that kind of what Zipf's law says. It says that word frequency is inversely proportional to its rank. So what? 
```{r}
# two group by, one by conversation and one by total words in the sample
words1 = full_d_raw %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word,Unit)
  count(B2,Word,sort = TRUE)

words2 = words1 %>% 
  group_by(B2) %>% 
  summarize(ctotal = sum(n))
  

wordcount <- left_join(words1, words2)
```
