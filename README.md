### RStudio-NCSU

# This project examines the Persuasion for Good dataset collected by MIT's Wang et al. (2019). The original paper and dataset can be found at (https://gitlab.com/ucdavisnlp/persuasionforgood/tree/master/data). This project uses text analysis to perform a number of exploratory techniques, including tf-idf, log-odds, and unsupervised clustering. This project was produced in collaboration with NC State University and the RStudio Foundation's mentorship program under the direction of Dr. Julia Silge and Professor Marcia Gumpertz.
