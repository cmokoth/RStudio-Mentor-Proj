```

## R Markdown
What do these datasets look ike?
```{r read in data}
# full_d for the full dialog, not annotated
full_d = read_csv('~/RStudio-Mentor-Proj/data/FullData/full_dialog.csv',
         col_names = T)
colnames(full_d)
full_d %>% relocate(B2,B4)
# full_i for the corresponding index file
full_i = read_csv('~/RStudio-Mentor-Proj/data/FullData/full_info.csv',
         col_names = T)
str(full_i)

# ann_d for the full dialog, with annotations
ann_d = read_xlsx('~/RStudio-Mentor-Proj/data/AnnotatedData/300_dialog.xlsx',
         col_names = T)
# ann_i for the corresponding index file
ann_i = read_xlsx('~/RStudio-Mentor-Proj/data/AnnotatedData/300_info.xlsx',
         col_names = T)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
