## read datasets
What do our datasets look like?
```{r read in data}
# full_d for the full dialog, not annotated
full_d = read_csv('data/FullData/full_dialog.csv',
         col_names = TRUE)
full_d %>% 
  relocate(B2,B4,Turn) %>% 
# full_i for the corresponding index file
  head()

full_i = read_csv('data/FullData/full_info.csv',
         col_names = TRUE)
str(full_i)

# THESE VARIABLES COULD BE FACTOR: as.factor(sex.x,race.x,edu.x,marital.x,employment.x,religion.x,ideology.x)

#as.factor(,ordered = F)
# ann_d for the full dialog, with annotations
ann_d = read_xlsx('data/AnnotatedData/300_dialog.xlsx',
         col_names = TRUE)
head(ann_d)
# ann_i for the corresponding index file
ann_i = read_xlsx('data/AnnotatedData/300_info.xlsx',
         col_names = TRUE)
head(ann_i)
```

## cleaning

## tidyr

What can we do with tidyr? Here are some transformations from chapter 1 of Silge's Text Mining With R  
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
