## Looking at Chapter 1

As the specific form of the Persuasion datasets is currently unknown, I practice here alongside Silge's Text Mining With R. 
```{r datasets}
# read in 'text'
text <- c("Because I could not stop for Death -",
          "He kindly stopped for me -",
          "The Carriage held but just Ourselves -",
          "and Immortality")

text

text_df <- tibble(line = 1:4, text = text)

text_df
```
Now to go from lines to words (for tidy text method, each word is a token. In Persuasion, they examine each sentence as a token)
```{r}
unnest_tokens(words,text)

full_d_raw %>% filter(str_detect(Dialogue,"Âª ")) %>% pull(Dialogue)
```
