knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Exploratory Analysis

What's in our data? Let's take a look through some plots.

```{r cars}
colnames(fulltidy)
fulltidy %>% count(Word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(word,n)) +
  geom_col()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
